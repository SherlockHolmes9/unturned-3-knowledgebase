# Uploading Log Files

Your log files contain important troubleshooting information.

## Finding your log files

1. Navigate to your unturned folder
    1. Open your steam library
    2. right click on Unturned, and select properties on the dropdown
    3. navigate to local files, and choose `browse local files`
2. Open the Logs folder

    !!! note
        `Client.log` is from your most recent session

        `Client_Prev.log` is from the session before then

3. Optionally, upload your logs a service like [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/), [Hastebin](https://hastebin.com/) or [paste.gg](https://paste.gg) to make sharing easier.
